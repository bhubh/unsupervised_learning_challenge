# unsupervised_learning_challenge
In this project I use unsupervised machine learning algorithms to classify the subjects with different features collected to study myopia. 
<br>

First I created the feature-only dataframe by removing the target class. The feature number was reduced by using principal component analysis (PCA). I also used TSNE model to further reduce the features obtained after using PCA.

The elbow curve was then plotted to estimate best number of classes from for the features.
